# hello everyone

I'm Sai Mahendra Bejawada, diving into the world of computer science at KLEF, Vaddeswaram. I find immense joy in crafting web experiences, especially with React at the frontend and dabbling in Firebase and MongoDB on the backend. Beyond the coding realm, I explore the wonders of tools like Notion, Figma, and WordPress. If you fancy a peek into my coding adventures, swing by my CodePen haven at https://codepen.io/sunstromium. And catch me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/bejawada-sai-mahendra-b18289212/. Let's build digital wonders together!
