I'm Sai Mahendra Bejawada, studying computer science at KLEF in Vaddeswaram. I enjoy creating web experiences, particularly with React on the frontend while experimenting with Firebase and MongoDB on the backend. Additionally, I delve into tools such as Notion, Figma, and WordPress. If you would like to view my coding adventures, please visit my CodePen haven at https://codepen.io/sunstromium.
